# pscards/card-extender


## Overview
KiCad project for creating a extender card. The extender card is useful for working on a Korg PS-Series Polyphonic Synthesizer.

The card is a pass-through board that extends a card outside the Korg synth chassis, to enable easier access while diagnosing and repairing

The extender card plugs-in to Korg synth backplane, and provides 2 44-pin card socket connections to host the Korg KLM board.
