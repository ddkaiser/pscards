<H2>Custom cards for restoring or repairing Korg PS-3x00 polyphonic synthesizers</H2>
<P>
Korg Polyphonic Synthesizers (PS-3100, PS-3200, PS-3300) are complex and expensive synthesizers, but as these instruments are now at least 45 years old, occasionally their original parts fail, and there is a need for recreated parts, in order to keep the instrument in operating condition.

This project is to create spare circuit boards to keep these old synthesizers operating.
